# **App Name**: Thread Weaver

## Core Features:

- Code Editor: Basic code editor with syntax highlighting for C and related languages.
- Compilation & Execution: Allow compiling and running the C code directly from the editor.  Capture any command line output from running the compiled code.
- Pthread Generation: Generative AI feature that can suggest boilerplate code and helpful algorithms based on your source code and the current selection. It uses its tool for C code snippets for pthreads from the web to give useful code generation responses to users.
- Output Display: Display the compiled program output in a formatted text.
- Code Saving: Allow code files to be downloaded to the user's device, and uploaded into the editor.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey stability, depth, and focus, complementing the coding environment.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) providing a neutral backdrop that reduces eye strain during long coding sessions.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF5AF2), contrasting the deep blue to highlight interactive elements.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for clear and legible display of code.
- Body text: 'Inter', sans-serif.
- Use a set of minimalist icons for common actions such as compiling, running, saving, and opening files.
- Divide the screen into three main sections: code editor, output display, and an optional panel for AI suggestions or controls.
